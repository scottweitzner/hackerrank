Possible Outcomes of Rolling two 6 Sided Dice:

(1,1)(2,1)(3,1)(4,1)(5,1)(6,1)
(1,2)(2,2)(3,2)(4,2)(5,2)(6,2)
(1,3)(2,3)(3,3)(4,3)(5,3)(6,3)
(1,4)(2,4)(3,4)(4,4)(5,4)(6,4)
(1,5)(2,5)(3,5)(4,5)(5,5)(6,5)
(1,6)(2,6)(3,6)(4,6)(5,6)(6,6)
Total: 36

Outcomes where values rolled by each die are different and the two dice have a sum of 6:

(5,1)
(4,2)
(2,4)
(1,5)
Total: 4


Probability = 4/36 = 1/9
